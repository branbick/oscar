This is the Open-Source Control Algorithms Repository (OSCAR), the goal of which is to centralize and share important algorithms used in the field of control systems.

I believe an algorithm in itself is only minimally helpful; what is drastically more beneficial is actually *understanding* the algorithm, the theory that undergirds it. Unfortunately, I've often found it difficult to acquire--or simply identify--the "literature" necessary to gain that understanding. Therefore, each of OSCAR's algorithms is accompanied by documentation that thoroughly presents the algorithmic background, derivation, etc.

Contributors are welcome and appreciated! :)
