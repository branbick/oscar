This is the Open-Source Control Algorithms Repository (OSCAR), a new project I'm working on to centralize and share important algorithms used in the field of control systems.

I believe an algorithm in itself is only minimally helpful; what is drastically more beneficial is actually *understanding* the algorithm, the theory that undergirds it. Unfortunately, I've often found it difficult to acquire--or simply identify--the "literature" necessary to gain that understanding. Therefore, each of OSCAR's algorithms is accompanied by documentation that thoroughly presents the algorithmic background, derivation, etc.

I'm really excited for this project and absolutely welcome contributors!
